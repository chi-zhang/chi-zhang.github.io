Education
======
* B.S. in Pharmacy, West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University, 2007-2011
  * GPA: 3.63/ 4.0 (top 1%)
* M.S. in Pharmaceutics, Fudan University, 2011-2014    
  * Thesis: Brain-targeted nano-delivery system for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease
  * Supervisor: Prof. Xinguo Jiang (Chief scientist of China 973 Program)
                Prof. Qizhi Zhang
  * GPA: 3.70/ 4.0 (top 1%)

Work experience
======
* 2015-Now: Clinical Pharmacist  
  * Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University

* 2014-2015: Pharmacist
  * Shanghai Children’s medical center, Shanghai Jiaotong University

Research Experience
======
* 2016-Present   Evidence-Based pharmacy, systematic literature review, meta-analysis
  * Focus on the efficacy and safety about anticoagulants (involving warfarin & non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants)
  * Evaluated the relationship between non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and cognitive impairment in atrial fibrillation patients
  * Investigated the risk of renal impairment in atrial fibrillation patients receiving non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants
  * Reported a case on ticagrelor-induced life-threatening bleeding via drug interaction
* 2011-2018    Brain-targeted nano-delivery system for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
  * Developed a dual-functional nanoparticle drug delivery system, for blood-brain barrier transport and Aβ42 targeting. With encapsulation of β-sheet breaker peptide, the delivery system showed good neuroprotective effects on AD model mice. (NSFC No. 81273461)
  * Conducted a brain neuron-targeted nanoparticle gene delivery system for AD treatment. Encapsulated with siRNA drug, the nano-delivery system presented neuroprotective effects on AD model mice. (NSFC No. 81502991)
