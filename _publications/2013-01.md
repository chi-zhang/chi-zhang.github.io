##Purpose
A phage-displayed peptide TGN was used as a targeting motif to help the delivery of NAP-loaded nanoparticles across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which sets an obstacle for brain delivery of NAP in vivo.

##Methods
Intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-40 into mice was used to construct in vivo model of Alzheimer’s disease. The water maze task was performed to evaluate the effects of the NAP formulations on learning and memory deficits in mice. The neuroprotective effect was tested by detecting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and conducting histological assays.

##Results
Intravenous administration of NAP-loaded TGN modified nanoparticles (TGN-NP/NAP) has shown better improvement in spatial learning than NAP solution and NAP-loaded nanoparticles in Morris …
